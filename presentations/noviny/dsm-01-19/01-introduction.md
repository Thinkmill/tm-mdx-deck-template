Hi, I'm Ben

I work for Thinkmill

I've been working on Atlassian's Design System Team on Atlaskit

## In the beginning...
```notes
The launch of the adg website, and where we were
```

## We ended up with two websites:

## Design System Challenges

<ul style={{ textAlign: 'left' }}>
  <Appear>
    <li>Complex</li>
    <li>Componentized</li>
    <li>Collaborative</li>
    <li>Evolving</li>
  </Appear>
</ul>

```notes
These problems are not unique to design systems, but are the major themes that you should be thinking about to do design system work.

On componentized - this means that there are two layers of documentation:
- System documentation - about using the design system as a general guide
- component documentation - information specific to only a single component

Cool quote that got cut: "Your take-aways from a project are the problems you faced along the way"
